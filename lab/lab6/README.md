# CS135-Lab6

## Lab Goals
The goal of this Lab is to:
1.	Familiarize students with **segmentation faults**.
2.	Allow students to modify a program which uses **pointers**.
### Important Notes:
1.	**Comments**: Header comments are required on all files and recommended for the rest of the program. Points will be deducted if no header comments are included.
2.  **Filename**: Modify the existing files and save your changes there.
## The Assignment
Your task is to modify the program provided.  

**lab6_seg_fault.c**  
Compile and run this program on your machine. Did you see a ```Segmentation fault (core dumped)``` error message? This is the error you see during runtime when your pointers aren't being used properly. One line of code, just under the comments on lines 10 and 11, will fix this program right up! Add that line of code and submit the modified program to your repository.  

## Submission details
To submit your project, you will have to use git on your VirtualBox installation:
1.	After accepting the assignment invitation, copy the clone URL
2.	Type 
```git clone clone_URL```
3.	cd into your new assignment directory
4.	After working on your files
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands:

## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.
