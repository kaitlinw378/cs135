# ProgrammingAssignment4

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1.	Familiarize students with the use of **pointers**
### Important Notes:
1.	**Formatting**: Make sure that you follow the precise recommendations for the output content and formatting. Your assignment will be auto-graded and any changes in formatting will result in a loss in the grade.
2.	**Comments**: Header comments are required on all files and recommended for the rest of the program. Points will be deducted if no header comments are included.
3.	**Filename**: Save your program as ```shoes.c```

## Program
Can you buy shoes with pointers?  

**The program should behave as follows:**  
Make sure your code uses pointers in place of any variables used after declaration. The program should store a sales tax of 0.0826 in a variable. The program should prompt the user for their budget and for the price of a pair of shoes. The program should then calculate the total price of the shoes, with sales tax applied. It should let the user know if they can buy the shoes or not. 

Here is an example of how the program could function:
```
>./shoes
What is your budget? 150
What is the price of the shoes you want? 199.99
Sorry! $216.51 for these shoes is out of your budget.
>./shoes
What is your budget? 120
What is the price of the shoes you want? 99.99
Congratulations! You can buy these shoes with $11.75 to spare!
```
## Requirements
Make sure your code uses pointers in place of any variables used after declaration. *This is not how we would normally write code. It is for educational purposes only.*    

## Submission details
To submit your project, you will have to use git on your VirtualBox installation:
1.	After accepting the assignment invitation, copy the clone URL
2.	Type 
```git clone clone URL```
3.	cd into your new assignment directory
4.	After working on your files
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands: 
```
git add .
git commit -m “your commit message”
git push

## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.
